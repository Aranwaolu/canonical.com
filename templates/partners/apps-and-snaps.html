        <h2>App developer partners</h2>
        <p>Thanks to the ease with which users can find and install software using the Ubuntu Software Centre, Ubuntu already supports thousands of client applications. With the launch of Ubuntu phones and tablets &mdash; and the resulting opportunity to target three client platforms with just one codebase &mdash; the Ubuntu app market is set to grow exponentially.</p>
