        <p>In marketing you are a representative of Canonical and you are an advocate of our brands and products. We all work together across the full portfolio &ndash; you are expected to understand the big picture of how Canonical's products fit together, there are no siloes. These are not behind-the-scenes roles, they are public leadership roles. We expect our team to be just as comfortable delivering our message online as they are face to face at meetups, meetings, conferences, partner workshops, or press events. From the analyst community to the tech press, from the CIO to the graduate engineer, from prospects to existing customers, we think Ubuntu should be the starting point for technology transformation around open source, and our marketing team are the amplifier for our message.</p>
        <p>This team is all about having the confidence in our ideas and our quality to put us squarely into the frame for companies thinking afresh about their biggest technology questions. Join us if you are passionate about digital marketing and technology products.</p>

        <p>Our team also understands that it's not just about broadcast, it's about feedback, measurement, iteration and improvement. We use analytics to understand how the world is consuming our narrative, and technology to sift through mountains of engagement data to spot the opportunities that are ready to explore further. We delight in showing that we can engineer growth in engagement, awareness, consumption and commerce just as effectively as our colleagues in software development engineer reliability and performance in their products. We are growth hackers at heart. As the tools evolve, so do we, which creates a learning environment that celebrates new ideas which can prove their effectiveness. We're a tiny company in an industry of giants, so we have always punched way above our weight and that's exactly what we expect from new members of the team too.</p>

        <p>The best candidates for marketing at Canonical love technology and words. They are tech-savvy and are comfortable working with data at scale &ndash; in spreadsheets, business analytics suites and databases. They love data visualisation and presentation. They are passionate about message and language, and strive to find the best way to share a powerful idea that leads people to act.</p>
        <p>Canonical has a global following of sophisticated tech readers and decision makers, constantly evaluating the state of the art for open infrastructure and applications. Your mission is to reach them at precisely the right moment with clear information showing that Ubuntu and Canonical's solutions deliver the very best in quality and economics. It's a fast-paced, high stakes responsibility that demands a high level of intellect and work ethic.</p>
