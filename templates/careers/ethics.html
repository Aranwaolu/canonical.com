        <strong>Trust is our most precious asset. We take our responsible for the most critical elements of every piece of open infrastructure in the software-defined world very seriously, and we are committed to quality in every aspect of our product and services. When people deploy Ubuntu, they trust Canonical to ensure that it is secure and robust, that it represents the best balance of possibility and pragmatism, and that it is the best way for them to benefit from and participate in the open source movement.</strong>

      <p>
        From time to time we know everybody has tough choices to make. We support our leads in doing things properly, even if that means taking extra time. We expect a high level of productivity but we expect much of that effort to go into quality. Most importantly, we have an uncompromising approach to ethics and do not tolerate ambiguity when it comes to the interests of our customers. Ethical failures are grounds for dismissal from the team.
