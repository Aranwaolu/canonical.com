      <p>Software can appear to be immaterial, yet engineers, servers, and the buildings that host them are very real. As a technology company, we are conscious of the fact that our work and our products have an environmental impact.  Whether it's travelling to see customers,  running a data centre, or just making Ubuntu energy efficient for all our users, we want to make thoughtful choices that consider our impact. Climate change caused by carbon emissions poses a global threat to all humans. Weâ€™re hitting a number of planetarity limits at the very moment where we need to transform our societies the most. Optimising how we operate as a business and delivering products designed with sustainability in mind should be part of that transformation.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>We have raised <em>internal awareness</em> regularly through plenaries with expert speakers. We built an internal Team Member Resource Group where we regularly discuss team initiatives and where employees help one another around sustainability topics.</p>
        <p>In 2022, we concluded our first <em>carbon footprint</em> assessment with a brilliant consulting firm, Carbone 4.  We looked at carbon emissions from our globally distributed workplace, including our core business and operations. We  factored in the use of our products all over the world. We presented the study's findings to employees and this led to new ambitions to transform our company.</p>
        <p>We created a <em>position in engineering</em> to drive the technical plans around energy efficiency across all of our products from the kernel to Ubuntu Desktop, devices and data centres, liaising with our strategic partners.</p>
