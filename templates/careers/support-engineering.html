      <p class="u-sv2">Support Engineering roles include IT experts and managed services operators across a vast portfolio of open source projects. We support, test, fix and operate the Ubuntu OS, infrastructure such as Kubernetes, LXD, OpenStack, MAAS, and a growing portfolio of open source applications. We believe in customer-centricity, working with the community and smart operations through code. The robots we are constructing to run the data centre need to be backed by humans that care about the needs of our users.</p>

        <p>While we all enjoy the feeling that comes from passionately working together, we also collectively respect each other's lives away from work. Part of standing together with a global team that is set up to work remotely means you can step away during your off-hours and know that your team has your back. Your manager will guide and mentor you through your work but equally wants you to make sure you are taking the time away from work to help you unwind and refocus. All of us are in this together, and we want you in Support Engineering for the long term.</p>
