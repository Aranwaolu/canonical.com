        <p>In Support Engineering, you will enjoy the excitement of a team that is fun, diverse, distributed globally and incredibly competent. Every day, we deliver the expertise our customers need to solve some of the worldâ€™s most challenging problems.</p>
        <p>While we all enjoy the feeling that comes from passionately working together, we also collectively respect each other's lives away from work. Part of standing together with a global team that is set up to work remotely means you can step away during your off-hours and know that your team has your back. Your manager will guide and mentor you through your work but equally wants you to make sure you are taking the time away from work to help you unwind and refocus. All of us are in this together, and we want you in Support Engineering for the long term.</p>
