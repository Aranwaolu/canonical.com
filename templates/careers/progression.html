        Joining Canonical means joining an intense global mission - to deliver the worldâ€™s best open source experience, from platform to application. We touch every aspect of open source technology, and so we offer a wide range of technology and business careers. You might start out as a product developer, then choose to get more travel and focus on customer operations transformation and cloud operations, then take on a role in tech leadership or management. We value people who love to learn - not just how to be a better engineer, but how to be a better speaker, how to be a better designer, better organiser, better partner and better vendor.
