        <p>Getting it done right is the best feeling in the world. No shortcuts, no loose ends, no waste. It's only possible to operate with mastery if you understand the domain deeply, you prioritise re-use and iteration, and you bring a sharp mind to the problem. A well-run operation invests in improving its data and its tools to elevate its self-awareness and automate its processes. Fighting fires is the exception, not the norm, and those moments are an opportunity to learn and improve.</p>
