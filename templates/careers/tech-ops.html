{% block overview %}
  <p><strong>TechOps, or Technical Services and Operations role ranges from IT and managed services to developing commercial systems used by our company. We develop, test, ship and operate the systems that drive Canonical and underpin Ubuntu. We believe in a strong customer service ethic and operations through code. The robots we are constructing to run the data centre need to be backed by humans that care about the needs of our users and customers.</strong></p>
  <p>In TechOps, you will enjoy the excitement of a team environment that is fun, diverse, distributed globally and incredibly competent. Every day, we work to enable our customers to work on some of the most challenging problems in the world.</p>
  <p>While we all enjoy the feeling that comes from passionately working together, we also collectively respect each other's lives away from work. Part of standing together with a global team that is set up to work remotely means you can step away during your off-hours and know that your team has your back. Your manager will guide and mentor you through your work but equally wants you to make sure you are taking the time away from work to help you unwind and refocus. All of us are in this together, and we want you in TechOps for the long term.</p>
  <p>If you enjoy supporting customers, operating software or building software, then TechOps at Canonical will present you with the challenging work environment to help you grow. We welcome you to apply with us!</p>
